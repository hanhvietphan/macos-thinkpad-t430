Credits goes to ThiagoSchetini & Rehabman, thanks bunches!

* Display Port Out: FullHD + Audio
* Battery Status
* WiFi (I use an Atheros AR5BHB92 [rebranded](https://github.com/ThiagoSchetini/AR9285-rebranding))
* Ethernet
* Sleep
* Display turns on automatically on wake/instant wake

* Bluetooth: bought and installed this [BT daughter card](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-shipping-New-original-bluetooth-module-4-0-for-Lenovo-Thinkpad-X220-X230-T420-T430-T530/1640038938.html) worked out of the box. *Sadly no Handoff - yet*


#### NOT WORKING ...
* On Shutdown, sometimes need to remove USB devices otherwise system will restart.
* SSD Trim (Works, but I have disabled it.)
* VGA output (No support.)
* SD Card Reader <- never tested.



#### Creating the installer
	- You'll need thumbdrive of at least 8 GB, jHFS+ formatted.

    - Use Unibeast to create the installer. Select UEFI and no ATI/nVidia.

	- After creating the USB Installer go to EFI/CLOVER/drivers64UEFI/
		Remove everything and put the 4 files this repository (add the apfs.efi if need be)

	- Put any kexts in EFI/CLOVER/kexts/10.12 etc. into ./other/ and copy the kexts from this
	  repository into ./other/ as well.
		- Thus removing all kexts folders except ./other/


#### Install macOS
    - You'll need a mouse and external keyboard plugged in (for the install process).

	- If you get stuck on boot disable 'InjectIntel' graphics.

##### Install on Fusion Drive (Optional)
If you have installed an SSD and a HDD in your T430, you can gain the advantages of using a fusion drive. Follow these steps to install on a fusion drive rather than a "regular" drive.

	- Setup Fusion drive according to guides on the internet.

	- Install macOS on external HDD.

	- Restore HDD installation to Fusion Drive with Disk Utility on the install disk.

	- *Alternatively* (never got this to work) do `/Volumes/"Image Volume/Install macOS High Sierra.app"
    	/Contents/Resources/startosinstall --volume the_target_volume--converttoapfs NO --agreetolicense`
    	from Terminal instead of regular install.

	- Boot into new installation on Fusion Drive.


#### Show hidden files (optional, but helpful)
	- After first boot, on Terminal:
    	defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES
		killAll Finder


#### Install Clover

	- Install “clover.pkg” (found in repo/tools folder)
    	Check 'Install for UEFI Booting Only'
		This will automatically check 'Install Clover in the ESP'
		Check Drivers 64 UEFI (IMPORTANT! Do only check OsxAptioFix2Drv-64)

	- Now you can remove your Installer Pen Drive (you have boot)


#### Configure EFI/Clover
	- config.plist: use the one from this repository
        take from low-resolution-config.plist folder for 1366x768 display
		take from high-resolution-config.plist folder for 1600x900 or + display

	- /drivers64UEFI
		use the folder from this repository (with 4 files only!)

	- /kexts
		Remove everything except other (leave it empty)

	- /ACPI/patched:
		(OPTION 1 Difficult - but recommended) Make your own SSDT and DSDT:
			-> First you'll need the vanilla .aml generated by your UEFI (BIOS)
				Enter in the clover boot menu and press F4 and FN+F4
				That’s all. It’s gonna be on EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/origin

			-> Them disassembly correctly only the DSDT.aml and DSDT’s.aml (0, 1, 2 etc…)
				please, don’t open directly on MacIASL!
				use iasl on terminal (look at tools folder/iasl howTo.txt)

			-> patch your DSDT.dsl with all the code from file “…-dsdt-patch.txt” using MacIASL
				it includes only the necessary code to Thinkpad T430
				* choose low resolution for 1366 x 762
				* choose high resolution for 1600 x 900 or +
				
			NOTE:I DON'T CHANGE LAST THIS PATCH AND IT WORK WITH ME 	
			*****************************************************************************************
			*-> manually last patch for screen turn on after wake (Warning! It’s a manual change)	*
			*	on your .dsl find for “Return (WAKI)”						*
			*	On the last two method calls there is:						*
			*		\_SB.PCI0.LPC.EC.LED(Zero, 0x80)					*
    			*		\_SB.PCI0.LPC.EC.LED(0x07, 0x00)					*
			*	change for (carefull with identation, must be perfect):				*
			*		\_SI._SST (One)								*
        		*		\_GPE._L1D ()								*
			*****************************************************************************************
			-> Save from MacIASL as binary (.aml) and paste on ACPI/patched inside clover UEFI

			-> Generate your own SSDT (Power Management for your processor)
				https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/quick-guide-to-generate-a-ssdt-for-cpu-power-management.177456/
			-> Put the SSDT.aml on the same folder of DSDT: ACPI/patched inside clover UEFI


		(OPTION 2 Easy One - Not recommended) take my patched files .aml:
	 		->take ONLY the .aml files from “pached ACPI dsl’s” folder
				* choose only one SSDT.aml: “i5 3230M” or “i7 3632QM”
				* if you have another processor make your own SSDT or leave it empty

			-> Put the .aml files on the folder: ACPI/patched inside clover UEFI

#### Kexts

	- Make a beckup of AppleBacklight.kext (Brightness)
		Why? for future updates you need to reinstall the original and then reinstall the pached

		** Warning!, the backlight kext inside kexts folder is patched for T430 brightness full range control

	- Now, install all the kexts from the folder using “Kext Utility.app” (look inside tools folder)

#### Voodoo Extra Files (for Keyboard)

	- Go to the voodoo's' folder with the terminal
		sudo cp org.rehabman.voodoo.driver.Daemon.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
		sudo cp VoodooPS2Daemon /usr/bin


#### Restart at get audio working

	- After restarting you need to flush the kexts:
		sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions && sudo kextcache -u /
	- Restart again to hear the audio working!

	- Repeat the process if nescessary
		sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions && sudo kextcache -u /
	- Restart Again!

	* If you keep having problems, try disabling the option 'No Cache' in config.plist and restart again.


#### HWMONITOR
	- Put the HWMONITOR from tools folder in Applications and open it, you should read power, clock, and temps of your CPU


#### Disable Hibernation
	-> Disable Hibernation and related options
        sudo pmset -a hibernatemode 0
        sudo rm /var/vm/sleepimage
        sudo mkdir /var/vm/sleepimage
        sudo pmset -a standby 0
        sudo pmset -a autopoweroff 0

**And that's it! You're done. (Hopefully.)** =)


#### ABOUT THIS DSDT CODE

    -> ThiagoSchetini modified some original patches from Rehabman:

			[modified] Lenovo X220
				-> added T430 sleep leds
				-> cleaned extra code

			[modified] Brightness fix (HD3000/HD4000)
				-> included FN brightness keys (T430 only)

			[usb] USB3_PRW 0x0D (instant wake)
				-> to have sleep working (original Rehabman code)

			[audio] Audio Layout 28
				-> to work with the ALC269 kext (original Rehabman code)

			[sys] IRQ Fix
				-> to enable audio (original Rehabman code)

			[igpu] Low Resolution (or High)
				-> to enable HDMI display port audio out

			[manual] Code change on .dsl to turn on screen automatically on wake


#### COMPLETE KEXT FLUSH (recomended after remove a kext)

	-> repair permissions:
        sudo /usr/libexec/repair_packages --repair --standard-pkgs --volume /

    -> rebuild kext cache
        sudo rm -r /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kext.caches
        sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions
        sudo kextcache -update-volume /

	-> rebuild cache short form
        sudo touch /System/Library/Extensions && sudo kextcache -u /


#### GENERATE VANILLA CONFIG.PLIST (if you need it)

	on /usr/local/bin/clover-genconfig > config.plist
	execute and take the xml
